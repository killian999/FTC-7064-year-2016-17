Sup guys it's killian, VP and software lead, this is our competition code! plz record everything you
code here so I know who and what you did. we will only need one driver code. Autonomous we will only need a max of 4.

board:(only lead can change this)
 - driver coders will develope a FULL code for the prototype bot
 - autonomous will develope a autonomous program to knock the yoga ball of the center base then take the beacon
 and finish by parking on our team's conner base

Ex: killian pignault - AutoOP.java - experimental autonomous code - 10/11/16
                                - changer driver speed from 1 to .75 on first driver method - 10/11/16
           (note you only hve to do this once a day and only after you change something from base code)
